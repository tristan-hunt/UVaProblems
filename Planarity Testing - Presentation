Planarity Testing - Presentation

1. Introduction
    a. What is Planarity?
        Recall - Biconnected graph.
        Faces of a graph, 
        Definition of a vertex on an external face. 
        game -> demonstration of planarity

2. UVa Problem - Given a graph, is it planar?
3. Theory -  Kurowtowski Subgraph --> Graph is planar iff 
    there is a kurotowski subgraph homeomorphic to it.
4. O(n) Algorithms: Path Addition, Vertex Addition, Edge Addition, Construction Sequence Method
5. Edge Addition Algorithm --> "can be implemented in only a few weeks" --> but, is available online. 
    defn: We say that w is externally active if there is a
path from w to a DFS ancestor u of v consisting of a back edge plus zero or 
more DFS descendants of w, none of which are in B
